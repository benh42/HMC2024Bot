## Important information:
This is the code for the ApplePi bot that runs in the class of 2025 server. If you would like to add to it, feel free to do so, however, you should not be testing the bot in the server (we don't want to spam it too much...). Here is the link with instructions on how to set up a bot in your server: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-music-bot-using-discord-js-4436f5f3f0f8/. To test on your own server with code, download this code, change the token in the auth.json file to your own bot's token and run the bot.js file!
